        <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
            <p>This smash burger recipe makes super juicy burgers with crispy edges.Don't use</p>
            <p>meat that is leaner than 80/20 for best results, and make sure the meat is very</p>
            <p>cold. I prefer to cook these outdoors to avoid smoking up the kitchen. These grill</p>
            <p>up very fast because of the high heat, so make sure you have everything ready to go!</p>

        <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
            <ul>
                <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened, or as needed</li>
                <li>1 pound ground chuck beef 80% lean</li>
                <li>4 6-inch squares parchment paper</li>
                <li>salt to taste</li>
                <li>4 slices American cheese</li>
                <li>burger toppings of choice</li>
            </ul>


        <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Set a cast iron flat-top </p>
                    <p>griddle or large cast iron skillet onto the grill and preheat until smoking.</p></li>
                <li><p>Spread butter on the inside of the buns and toast on the flat-top until lightly browned. Set aside.</p></li>
                <li><p>Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls, 2 ounces each. Do not pack the meat</p>
                    <p>tightly, as this will prevent it from smashing properly. Place each ball on the hot</p>
                    <p>flat-top, cover with a piece of parchment (to prevent sticking to the spatula; re-use </p>
                    <p>each parchment square on a second patty) and immediately smash down to</p>
                    <p>a 1/4 inch thickness using 2 stiff, sturdy spatulas that are criss-crossed to get</p>
                    <p>proper leverage as you press down. You may also use the bottom of small skillet.</p>
                    <p>Sprinkle the meat with salt.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brown and the centers are a</p>
                    <p>light pink color. Using a bench scraper or firm spatula, gently scrape up the</p>
                    <p>patties, flip over and immediately cover 4 of them with cheese. Grill an</p>
                    <p>additional 15 to 20 seconds; stack the plain patties over the cheese-covered</p>
                    <p>patties so you have 4 stacks. Move each stack to a bun and serve with your</p>
                    <p>favorite toppings.</p>
                    <p></p></li>
